# EvolvingWorld

This project visualizes the evolution of a digital world as the market cap of the `Vidanova999` memecoin increases. Each milestone adds new features to the world, creating an engaging and dynamic experience for users and investors.

## Features

### World Evolution Stages:
- **$0â€“24,999:** Pitch blackness (nothing exists yet).
- **$25,000:** A Big Bang event occurs, and a planet is created.
- **$50,000:** A sun appears to bring light to the planet.
- **$75,000:** Grass or land is added, making the planet more habitable.

Future updates will add additional features as higher market caps are reached.
